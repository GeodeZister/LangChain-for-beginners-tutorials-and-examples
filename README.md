## What is LangChain? ##

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for interacting with LLMs, as well as a number of other features that make it easier to build applications that use LLMs.

**There are a number of benefits to using LangChain**

- Ease of use: LangChain provides a standard interface for interacting with LLMs, which makes it easier to switch between different LLMs.
- Flexibility: LangChain allows you to create chains of calls to LLMs, which can be used to build more complex applications.
- Power: LangChain can be used to build a wide variety of applications that use LLMs.

**Examples of LangChain applications**

Some examples of applications that have been built using LangChain include:

- Chatbots
- Question-answering applications
- Document analysis applications
- Code analysis applications

## Installing and configuring LangChain ##

To install LangChain, you can use the following command:

<pre>pip install langchain</pre>

After you have installed LangChain, you need to configure it to use a specific LLM. You can do this by creating a configuration file that specifies the LLM you want to use and other settings.

<pre>llm = "openai"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"</pre>

## The first program on LangChain using openAI ##

For better understanding, the explanation will be based on the following code:

<pre>
import openai
from key import APIKEY
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import streamlit as st

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]=APIKEY

#streamlit init
st.title('YOUR_FIRST_LLM_MODEL')
input_text = st.text_input("Ask me below ↓")

#openai init
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.8)

if input_text:
    st.write(llm(input_text))
</pre>

The code will also be available in a file called example_1.py

The application first imports the necessary libraries, including **openai**, **os**, **streamlit**, and **langchain**. The **os** library is used to set the environment variable for the OpenAI API key. The **streamlit** library is used to create the web application. The **langchain** library is used to interact with the OpenAI LLM.

<pre>import openai
from key import APIKEY
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import streamlit as st</pre>

The next few lines of code create the web application. The **st.title()** function sets the title of the application. The **st.text_input()** function creates a text box where the user can enter their question or prompt.

<pre>
st.title('YOUR_FIRST_LLM_MODEL')
input_text = st.text_input("Ask me below ↓")
</pre>

The **llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.8)** line creates an instance of the OpenAI class. The temperature parameter is set to **0.8**, which means that the LLM will be more creative.

<pre>llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.8)</pre>

The if input_text: line checks to see if the user has entered any text. If the user has entered text, the **st.write(llm(input_text))** line will generate a response from the LLM and display it in the web application.

<pre>if input_text:
    st.write(llm(input_text))</pre>

You can also experiment with different values for the temperature parameter. For example, if you set the temperature to 0.5, the LLM will be more conservative in its responses. If you set the temperature to 1.0, the LLM will be more creative in its responses.
